# C - Search Algorithms

This directory contains files generated during the Search Algorithms lesson of the
ALX Software Engineering program. The files contain implementations of linear and
binary search algorithms, as well as space and time complexities for specified
functions.

The following scripts are included:

- 0-linear.c: a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm
- 1-binary.c: a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm
- 2-O: contains the time complexity (worst case) of a linear search in an array of size n
- 3-O: contains the space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n
- 4-O: contains the time complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n
- 5-O: contains the space complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n
- 6-O: contains the space complexity of a given function
