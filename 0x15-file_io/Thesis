There is a long history of geochemical studies aimed at understanding
the oxygenation history of the atmosphere and oceans, including observations
from redox-sensitive elements and isotopic systems. The broad outlines of the
oxygenation history of the atmosphere and oceans are now reasonably well known,
although the oxygenation of the oceans, and many of the processes that were
responsible for the major transitions in the oxidation state of the atmosphere–ocean
system are still poorly defined. Several lines of investigation confirmed that
during the Archaean and Early Paleoproterozoic the atmosphere was largely or
entirely anoxic, as were the oceans, with the possible exception of oxygen oases in
the shallow oceans (e.g. Holland, 1994). This would suggest a decoupling between
oxygenation in the earth’s atmosphere and the oceans. Before the evolution of
photosynthetic O2-producing bacteria, such as cyanobacteria, free O2 in the Earth’s
atmosphere was less than 10-5 of the present-day atmospheric levels (PAL)
(e.g. Farquhar et al., 2000; Pavlov and Kasting, 2002). It is hypothesized that O2
concentrations in the atmosphere reached appreciable proportions between 2.4 and 2.1 Ga
(e.g. Roscoe, 1969; Bekker et al., 2004; Canfield, 2005), termed the Great Oxidation Event
(GOE; Holland, 2002; Fig. 1.1). This is based on the mass-independent fractionation (MIF) 
of sulphur isotopes, a distinctive process of isotope fractionation during which the amount
of isotope separation is not proportional to the difference in isotopic masses, in
sulphides and sulphates (e.g. Clayton et al., 1973; Farquhar et al., 2000). MIF signatures
are generated and preserved exclusively in conditions where atmospheric oxygen levels are
lower than 10-5 of PAL (Pavlov and Kasting, 2002). These signatures are absent from
sedimentary rocks formed after ca. 2.4–2.3 Ga (e.g. Farquhar et al., 2000; Guo et al., 2009;
Luo et al., 2016; Gumsley et al., 2017). The GOE coincides approximately with the first of
the great ‘Snowball Earth’ glaciations (Roscoe et al., 1969; Evans et al., 1997).
It is worth noting that the Earth’s oxygenation is protracted rather than just a single
event, therefore leading to suggestions that the Great Oxidation Event should be renamed
the Great Oxidation Period (e.g. Holland, 2002; Bekker et al., 2004; Guo et al., 2009;
Lyons et al., 2014).

Atmospheric O2 levels rose at the onset of the GOE and then remained constant at ~10-3
– 10-1 of PAL for about two billion years (e.g. Planavsky et al., 2014; Fig. 1.1).
