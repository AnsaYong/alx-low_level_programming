### Variables, if, if..else, and while ###

This repository contains source codes developed while learning about variables, and decision makers such as 
if and if...else statements as well as while loops. The files included are:
0-positive_or_negative.c - a program which assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed and prints a statemen saying whether th number is positive or not
1-last_digit.c - a program which assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed and then prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable
2-print_alphabet.c - a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line
3-print_alphabets.c - a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line
4-print_alphabt.c - a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line
5-print_numbers.c - a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line
6-print_numberz.c - a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line, using putchar
7-print_tebahpla.c - a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line, using putchar
8-print_base16.c - a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line, using putchar
9-print_comb.c - a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, using putchar
and a few additional tasks
